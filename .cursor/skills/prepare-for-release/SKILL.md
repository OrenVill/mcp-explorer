# Pre-Release Checklist — mcp-explorer

Use this skill before merging the release-please PR or publishing to npm.
Work through every section in order. Do not mark the release ready until all sections pass.

---

## 1. Static checks

Run all three in parallel — they are independent:

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b + vite build → dist/
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # vitest run
```

All three must exit 0. A failing build means the published package is broken. A lint error or test failure blocks release.

---

## 2. CLI smoke test

Start the built output the way an end-user would (not the Vite dev server):

```bash
mcp-explorer --no-open   # or: node bin/mcp-explorer.js --no-open
```

Confirm:
- The process starts without error.
- It prints the ready line: `mcp-explorer  ➜  http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
- `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4173/ | head -5` returns HTML (not an error page).

Then test the stop subcommand:

```bash
mcp-explorer stop
```

Confirm the process exits cleanly and the lock file is removed (check `bin/mcp-explorer.js` for the lock path).

**Why this matters:** The daemon/lock-file and stop subcommand were added in v0.6.0. If either is broken, the CLI is the user's primary entry point and the release is a regression.

---

## 3. Playwright UI walkthrough

Start the built server (`mcp-explorer --no-open`, port 4173) — prefer this over the Vite dev server since it's what users actually install.

Use the Playwright MCP tools (the `playwright` server configured globally). Work through each area below. For each item, navigate to the relevant part of the UI, take a screenshot, and confirm the described behavior before continuing.

### 3.1 Initial load / empty state

- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.
- Screenshot the full page.
- Confirm: left sidebar visible with no servers listed, a `+ Add` button present, middle and right columns show empty-state copy (not blank or errored).

### 3.2 Add Server dialog

- Click `+ Add`.
- Screenshot the open dialog.
- Confirm: Name field, URL field (placeholder suggesting `http://host:port/mcp`), optional Description field.
- Fill Name = `"Test"`, URL = `"http://localhost:9999/mcp"` (nothing listening there).
- Submit the form.
- Confirm: server appears in sidebar with a disconnected/error indicator — not a crash, not a blank state.

### 3.3 Server connection error state

- Click the `Test` server in the sidebar.
- Confirm: app shows a connection-failed or disconnected state — an error message or a "Connect" button. No white screen, no unhandled exception.
- Check the browser console for uncaught JS errors — there should be none.

### 3.4 Tab bar — Tools / Resources / Prompts

- After clicking the server, confirm the middle column shows a tab bar with at least **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts** tabs.
- Click each tab; confirm each renders without crashing (they may be empty since the server is unreachable).

### 3.5 Live MCP fixture server

For the full feature walkthrough, use the local fixture server at `http://localhost:3001/mcp`.

- Add a server named `"Fixture"` with URL `http://localhost:3001/mcp`.
- Confirm it connects successfully and lists tools, resources, and prompts.
- Use this server for the tool form, result pane, call history, bookmarks, search, export, resources, and prompts checks below.
- If port `3001` is not running, start the fixture server before continuing. Do not mark release ready without exercising this connected-server path.

### 3.6 Tool forms — all input types

Requires the live fixture server from 3.5. If it is unavailable, stop and report the blocker.

With a connected server that lists tools:
- **String param** → confirm a text `<input>` renders.
- **Number param** → confirm a number `<input>` renders.
- **Boolean param** → confirm a checkbox or toggle renders.
- **Enum param** → confirm a `<select>` renders with the correct options.
- **Object or array param** → confirm a **textarea** renders and accepts typed JSON. Type `{"key": "value"}` into it and confirm the characters appear. This was a bug fixed in v0.5.x — it is a regression risk.

### 3.7 Result pane — rich rendering

Tests the rich code rendering added in v0.6.0. Requires a connected server with invokable tools.

**Markdown text result:**
- Invoke a tool that returns markdown text.
- Confirm the result block shows a **Code / Preview** toggle.
- Click Preview → markdown renders as styled HTML prose (headings, bold, lists), not raw `**bold**` or `## heading`.
- Click Code → flips back to raw text, Shiki syntax-highlighted.

**Code block / JSON result:**
- Invoke a tool that returns JSON.
- Confirm the result is syntax-highlighted with colored tokens (Shiki), not plain monospace.
- Confirm JSON is pretty-printed, not collapsed to one line.

**HTML resource:**
- Open the Resources tab, click an HTML resource.
- Confirm the Code / Preview toggle appears.
- Preview → an `<iframe>` renders the HTML.
- Code → raw HTML is Shiki-highlighted.

**Image resource:**
- If the server exposes any image resource (PNG, JPEG, SVG), confirm it renders as an `<img>` tag, not a data dump.
- For SVG specifically: confirm the Code / Preview toggle exists. Preview renders the SVG as an image; Code shows the XML Shiki-highlighted.

**Export modal (fallback if no live server):**
- If tools have been invoked in this session, open the export dialog.
- Confirm the Shiki-highlighted code block renders inside the modal with colored tokens.
- If the export has a Markdown tab, confirm the **Code / Preview toggle** appears in the tab bar, and Preview renders prose.

### 3.8 Call history — semantic diff

- Invoke the same tool twice with slightly different arguments.
- Open the call history panel (history icon or tab near the tool detail area).
- Select two consecutive calls.
- Confirm a **semantic diff** is shown: a 3-column layout (old value | path | new value), NOT a raw line-level text diff.
- If arguments were identical, confirm it shows "no changes" or falls back gracefully rather than crashing.

### 3.9 Bookmarks persistence

- Click the bookmark icon on any tool.
- Confirm the icon changes state (bookmarked).
- Reload the page (F5 / hard reload).
- Confirm the bookmark persists — it is stored in compressed appData on disk, not just in memory.

### 3.10 Cross-server search

- If more than one server is connected, open the search UI and type a partial tool name.
- Confirm results come back from the correct server(s).
- With a single server, confirm search still filters the tool list correctly and doesn't crash.

### 3.11 Export / documentation generation

- With at least one tool invoked, open the Export dialog.
- Confirm the dialog renders output tab(s).
- Confirm the download/copy button is present and triggers without a JS error.

### 3.12 Meta-tool discovery ("Discover all tools")

- Connect to a server that exposes a meta-tool (`list_tools`, `search_tools`, `invoke_tool`, `get_manifest`, or similar).
- Confirm the **"Discover all tools"** button appears in the tool list column.
- Click it → confirm discovered tools appear in a collapsible section below the main list.
- Click a discovered tool → confirm its detail form opens and is invokable (routes through the proxy meta-tool).

### 3.13 Resources tab

- Navigate to the Resources tab on a connected server.
- Confirm resources are listed with name and MIME type.
- Click a text resource → ResourceDetail renders with correct content. For markdown or HTML content, the Code/Preview toggle must appear.
- If the server has resource templates (URI templates), confirm the variable inputs render correctly.

### 3.14 Prompts tab

- Navigate to the Prompts tab on a connected server.
- Confirm prompts are listed.
- Click a prompt → PromptDetail shows the argument form, with argument descriptions rendered below each input field.
- Submit the prompt → rendered messages appear. For any message content detected as markdown, confirm the Code/Preview toggle is present and functional.

### 3.15 Protocol Inspector

- Click **Dev Tools** in the top header and stay on the **Protocol Inspector** tab.
- Confirm the Protocol Inspector tab shows an empty state before any MCP calls are made.
- Connect to the live fixture server, invoke a tool, read a resource, and fetch a prompt.
- Reopen Dev Tools → Protocol Inspector and confirm the timeline includes entries for `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/list` / `resources/read`, and `prompts/list` / `prompts/get` as applicable.
- Click a timeline entry and confirm params, result or error, status, server name, timestamp, and duration render without crashing.
- If the connected server does not implement resources or prompts, confirm `resources/list` and/or `prompts/list` show as `unsupported`, not `error`; this means the server is healthy but that optional MCP capability is absent.
- Click **Copy event** and confirm the clipboard receives JSON for the selected event.
- Click **Clear** and confirm the timeline returns to the empty state.

### 3.16 Schema Lab

- Click **Dev Tools** in the top header and switch to the **Schema Lab** tab.
- Confirm Schema Lab shows connected server and tool selectors.
- Select a tool with required arguments and confirm required fields are highlighted in the parameter table.
- Confirm the schema summary shows root type, property count, required count, and optional count.
- Confirm validation notes render. A valid schema should show a positive/info note; malformed or unsupported schema shapes should show warning/error notes without crashing.
- Confirm generated example arguments are deterministic and match defaults, enum first values, and primitive fallback values.
- Click **Copy args** and confirm the clipboard receives JSON arguments.
- Click **Copy call** and confirm the clipboard receives a JSON-RPC `tools/call` payload with `method`, `params.name`, and `params.arguments`.
- From a selected tool detail page, click **Schema Lab** beside Arguments and confirm Dev Tools opens directly to Schema Lab for that tool.

## 4. CHANGELOG and version

- Open `CHANGELOG.md` — confirm the top section matches the version being released and lists all merged PRs/commits since the last tag.
- Open `package.json` — confirm `"version"` matches.
- Confirm `README.md` (GitHub version) and `README.npm.md` (npm version) reflect any new commands or features in this release.

---

## 5. Final gate

All of the above pass → merge the release-please PR. The GitHub Action will:
1. Tag the commit (`vX.Y.Z`)
2. Create a GitHub Release with the changelog section
3. Run `npm publish` (which fires `prepublishOnly` → swaps README → publishes → `postpublish` → restores README)

After the Action completes, verify:
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orenvill/mcp-explorer` shows the new version, and the README displayed is the npm-focused one (starts with install instructions, not the Layout section).
- In a clean shell: `npm install -g @orenvill/mcp-explorer@latest` → `mcp-explorer` → confirms it opens the browser correctly.
